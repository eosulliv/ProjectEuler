Project Euler - Problem 22
Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
    begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the 
    alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical 
    position in the list to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is 
    worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN 
    would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
